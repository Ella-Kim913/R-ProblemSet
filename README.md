# R Problem Set Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my work on an assignment involving the analysis of two main datasets using R. The assignment was structured to develop a comprehensive understanding of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in R.

## Datasets

- **Flight Dataset**: Integrated within R, this dataset provided a rich source of information regarding flight patterns.
- **Gapminder Dataset**: A collection of global data that tracks economic and demographic changes over time.

## Assignment Workflow

1. **Data Validation**: Examined the raw datasets for validity, ensuring that the data was clean and accurate for analysis.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Employed basic statistical methods to understand the underlying trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created a series of plots to illustrate relationships and trends within the datasets, leveraging the graphical capabilities of R.

## Packages Used

- `dplyr`: for data manipulation
- `ggplot2`: for creating sophisticated visualizations
- `stringr`: for string manipulation
- `tidyr`: for data tidying
